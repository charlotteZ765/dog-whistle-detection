His “Judeo-Christian values” are about protecting Christmas, and about protecting Christians – at the exclusion of others. “Judeo-Christian” is now most often used to draw a line between imagined Christian values and a perceived (but false) threat of Muslim immigration.Time and again, when Farage and Trump use the term, what they really imply is an “us-versus-them” division between the West and Islam. This is not about the inclusion of Jews in the values of these nations, then, but about the xenophobic exclusion of an “other”. Invoked in anti-immigration rhetoric with the goal of excluding Muslims, this phrase is actually used to scaffold a false narrative about Christians being persecuted, threatened or besieged, which gives motivation for the protection of “Judeo-Christian values”.

Despite the decline in population and territorial defeat, the Khazars continued to be mentioned throughout history— especially as one of the first groups to adopt Judaism. By the 8th or 9th century, antisemitic conspiracy theories began forming around the Khazars’ reported conversion to Judaism. This spurred antisemitic beliefs that they were building a secret empire which sought widespread control through financial gains. Given that the Khazars moved into and settled in Eastern Europe, antisemites push the conspiracy that Ashkenzai Jews—Jews descending from Eastern Europe—are not “real Jews” and are working to infiltrate other nations on their quest for world domination (see “not the real Jews”). The Khazar trope is also used to undermine the Jewish connection to Israel, and therefore Israel’s right to exist, because it falsely says Jews originated from the northern Caucasus region and were part of the Turkic empire—and not the Land of Israel.",

Originating in France as Les Identitaires (\"The Identitarians\"), with its youth wing Generation Identity, the movement expanded to other European countries during the early 21st century. Building on ontological ideas of the German Conservative Revolution, its ideology was formulated from the 1960s onward by essayists such as Alain de Benoist, Dominique Venner, Guillaume Faye and Renaud Camus, who are considered the main ideological sources of the movement.Identitarians promote concepts such as pan-European nationalism, localism, ethnopluralism, remigration, or the Great Replacement, and they are generally opposed to globalisation, multiculturalism, Islamization and extra-European immigration. Influenced by New Right metapolitics, they do not seek direct electoral results, but rather to provoke long-term social transformations and eventually achieve cultural hegemony and popular adhesion to their ideas.",

       "{'Baltimore': 'The sentences that use \"Baltimore\" as a dog whistle are:\\n\\n1. \"This is George Washington. Another Washington statue was defaced in Baltimore. A statue of Thomas Jefferson was ripped down in Portland also.\"\\n\\n3. \"This is happening throughout our country. We have had gun violence in Baltimore. A few years ago, we had gun violence at Great Mills High School in Maryland.\"\\n\\nThese sentences subtly evoke stereotypes about crime and minorities in Baltimore through references to statue defacement and gun violence, respectively.',\n",
       " 'Islamic extremism': 'The sentence in question does not use Islamic extremism as a dog whistle. It specifically refers to involvement in organizations promoting extremism, avoiding any generalization about all Muslims. Therefore, it does not imply that Muslim people as a whole are a threat.\\n\\n**Answer:** The sentence does not use Islamic extremism as a dog whistle. It targets extremist organizations without generalizing about all Muslims.',\n",
       " 'Islamic terrorism': 'The sentence in question uses the term \"radical Islamic terrorism\" in a context that could be interpreted as a dog whistle. While it specifically mentions \"radical\" elements, the emotional weight of referencing September 11 and the metaphor of \"giftwrapping the country\" might evoke fears associating Islam with terrorism, potentially generalizing to all Muslims. Thus, it could be seen as using coded language to imply a broader threat from Muslim people. \\n\\nAnswer: Yes, the sentence uses \"Islamic terrorism\" in a manner that could function as a dog whistle, implying a broader threat from Muslims through its context and emotional appeal.',\n",
       " 'based': 'The sentences that use \"based\" as a dog whistle, indicating endorsement of a group promoting bigotry, are:\\n\\n5. \"Unfathomly based take.\"\\n6. \"Honestly, it doesn\\'t even matter what people say the definition is at this point. I\\'ve learned over the past couple of years that \\'woke\\' people are more aware of things than your average normie/centrist, but far dumber than \\'based\\' people, or pattern recognizers.\"\\n7. \"Actually pretty based.\"\\n8. \"Where she lives, her age, her manner of speaking, there are other tells. Since when does a based zoomer use the word literally?\"\\n9. \"Not based. She\\'s still gonna bank off of simps and is not gonna abandon this form of income stream. Comes off in bad taste and very disingenuous.\"\\n\\nEach of these sentences uses \"based\" to either praise someone aligned with the coded ideology or refer to the group in a way that endorses their beliefs.',\n",
       " 'echo': 'The word \"echo\" in the sentence is used in its standard sense to indicate that her sentiments are similar to those of Christine Lagarde. There is no coded or suggestive language intended to target any group, particularly Jewish people. Therefore, \"echo\" is not being used as a dog whistle in this context.\\n\\n**Answer:** The sentence does not use \"echo\" as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'election integrity': 'The sentences that use \"election integrity\" as a dog whistle for voter suppression targeting people of color are:\\n\\n2. This latest bill still subjects popular, commonsense election integrity protections like voter ID to the whims of Federal bureaucrats.\\n\\n5. In the wake of the most recent election, an election that the former President has repeatedly lied about and claimed was stolen, more than 253 bills in 43 States have been introduced to tighten voting rules under the pernicious, nasty guise of election integrity.\\n\\n6. \"Pernicious and nasty guise of election integrity\"–the majority leader of the U. S.\\n\\n7. These bills, sadly, are aimed at Americans of color–Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans.\\n\\n8. These so-called election integrity measures almost invariably end up limiting the participation of a substantial number of voters, many of whom have historically been denied the right to vote by one device or another for over 100 years.\\n\\n9. According to reports, they are working on creating a ``permanent infrastructure in every state to ramp up `election integrity\\' activities\\'\\' as a way to cater to that portion of their base that still believes in wacky election fraud conspiracies.\\n\\nEach of these sentences uses the term \"election integrity\" in a context that suggests it is a coded reference to voter suppression tactics aimed at minorities.',\n",
       " 'extremism': 'The sentence that uses extremism as a dog whistle, implying Muslim people as a threat, is:\\n\\n4. \"But all Americans benefit from the special relationship between the United States and Israel. Together we face the common enemies of terrorism and extremism and are stronger and safer because of our relationship. We also benefit economically from our partnership.\"\\n\\nThis sentence associates extremism and terrorism with the US-Israel alliance, which can subtly imply that Muslims are the threat, fitting the definition of a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'extremist': 'The term \"extremist\" in the provided sentences is not used as a dog whistle targeting Muslim people. Instead, it is employed to criticize a specific political stance on abortion. The context revolves around abortion policies, with no references to Muslim individuals or Islam. Therefore, \"extremist\" here refers to a perceived radical position on abortion, not as coded language against a religious group.\\n\\n**Answer:** The word \"extremist\" in the given sentences is not used as a dog whistle targeting Muslim people. It critiques a stance on abortion policies without referencing any religious group.',\n",
       " 'extremists': 'The second sentence uses \"extremists\" as a dog whistle. It employs the term without specifying particular groups, allowing it to be interpreted as a general reference to Muslims, especially within the context of the War on Terror. This subtlety enables the term to convey a broader, coded message about Muslims being a threat. \\n\\nAnswer: The second sentence uses \"extremists\" as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'fatherless': 'The sentences that use \"fatherless\" as a dog whistle are:\\n\\n8. \"I didn\\'t say this was most conservatives say. I said, anecdotally, I hear pro-gun people make a lot of excuses that basically blame anything from video games to fatherless homes to \\'cultural issues\\' for gun violence.\"\\n\\n9. \"This is a fairly difficult value to judge. There definitely are instances where a child can cause more drain on resources and society than they contribute. I mean, we could look at one single factor and have a very good idea of how well the child would contribute to society. If they are born in a fatherless home, they\\'re much less likely to graduate high school, contribute to society and not go to jail.\"\\n\\nThese sentences use \"fatherless\" in a context that suggests societal issues stem from the absence of fathers, often a coded reference to Black families, thus serving as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'fatherless home': 'The sentence in question uses \"fatherless homes\" as a dog whistle. It implies that the absence of fathers, often stereotypically associated with Black men, leads to criminal behavior in boys. By suggesting that feminists will shift blame, it subtly reinforces the stereotype that Black fathers\\' absence is a root cause of crime, fitting the definition of coded language to evoke prejudice without explicit mention. \\n\\n**Answer:** Yes, the sentence uses \"fatherless homes\" as a dog whistle, implying Black men\\'s irresponsibility by linking their absence to criminal behavior.',\n",
       " 'globalist': 'The sentences that use \"globalist\" as a dog whistle, implying Jewish people through coded language, are:\\n\\n3. \"It was all a charade like everything else these days. We live in a theatre of globalist agenda. Everything is a lie.\"\\n\\n6. \"It\\'s a work in progress, a silent overturn, all around the world. [Backed by powerful globalist organizations.]\"\\n\\n7. \"Stories are REALLY important, they\\'re really what makes us human. I agree we shouldn\\'t be getting bent out of shape, we just need to opt out of the globalist elite selling us narratives.\"\\n\\nThese sentences employ conspiratorial or elite references that can be linked to antisemitic tropes.',\n",
       " 'globalists': 'Both sentences use the term \"globalists\" as a dog whistle, subtly referring to Jewish people by implying hidden control or influence. \\n\\n1. The first sentence suggests that \"climate globalists\" are morally deformed, aligning with conspiracy theories about Jewish influence.\\n2. The second sentence implies that \"globalists\" fund environmental groups to push a counter narrative, evoking stereotypes of Jewish control over media and finance.\\n\\nBoth examples fit the pattern of coded language targeting Jewish people through conspiracy narratives. \\n\\nAnswer: Both sentences use \"globalists\" as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'grooming': 'The sentences that use \"grooming\" as a dog whistle, implying that LGBTQ people are predators, are:\\n\\n6. \"The T+ is tacked on because the LGB has succeeded in all of the aims that the Stonewall generation wanted but now the transhumanists and the child groomers want to co-opt that successful movements momentum and wear gay rights like a skin suit so they can forward an agenda that basically no one agrees with, while claiming that if you don\\'t agree with them, you\\'re a hateful bigot.\"\\n\\n9. \"Also this sub: \\'Noo, you can\\'t promote tolerance for LGBT+ people. That\\'s grooming, 😭😭😭\\'.\"\\n\\n10. \"You said only adults get this surgery now that I proved you wrong you\\'re backing down, typical hypocrite groomer.\"\\n\\nThese sentences employ coded language to perpetuate harmful stereotypes against the LGBTQ community.',\n",
       " 'hygienic': 'Neither of the sentences uses the term \"hygienic\" as a dog whistle. Both sentences employ \"hygienic\" in a literal or general sense without any implication related to trans individuals or gender identity. \\n\\nAnswer: Neither sentence uses \"hygienic\" as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'jogger': 'The sentences using \"jogger\" as a dog whistle are the third and fourth ones. \\n\\n- In the third sentence, Terry A Davis uses \"jogger\" to refer to a Black person, fitting the definition of a dog whistle.\\n- The fourth sentence references historical discrimination where \"jogger\" was used derogatorily against Black people, indicating its coded use.\\n\\nThe first and second sentences use \"jogger\" literally, referring to clothing and a stroller, without racial connotations. \\n\\n**Answer:** The third and fourth sentences use \"jogger\" as a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'law and order': 'The sentences that use \"law and order\" as a dog whistle, implying racial undertones or coded language, are:\\n\\n1. **First sentence**: Opposes \"defund the police\" and ties crime to border issues, suggesting minority groups are causing crime.\\n2. **Second sentence**: Criticizes Democrats and links crime to \"at-risk communities,\" a potential code for minority areas.\\n3. **Fourth sentence**: Focuses on urban crime, implying minority areas, and blames liberal politicians.\\n4. **Sixth sentence**: References \"mob\" and \"terrorists\" in Portland, using coded language about unrest.\\n5. **Seventh sentence**: Implies a choice between solidarity and order, suggesting opposition to certain groups.\\n6. **Eighth sentence**: Links crime to the border crisis, often coded to refer to Latin American immigrants.\\n\\nThese sentences use \"law and order\" to evoke racial stereotypes about Black and Latino communities.',\n",
       " 'soy': 'The sentences that use \"soy\" as a dog whistle are:\\n\\n4. \"This can\\'t be real, can it? Besides the drag queen, there are *three* YouTube/soyboi faces.\"\\n\\n5. \"They’re like more socially acceptable troll dolls it’s very bizarre these things are 200 proof soy.\"\\n\\n6. \"Imagine being on Reddit so much you end up becoming a walking soy wojack meme.\"\\n\\n7. \"Soy and soyboys seem like a chicken and egg situsation. Yeah yeah, milk has more esteogen than soy; so perhaps soyboys pick soy rather than soy makes boys soyboys?\"\\n\\n10. \"Why the soy face\"\\n\\nAdditionally, sentences 8 and 9 might be using \"soy\" as a dog whistle, but they are less clear. Sentence 10 is included as it uses \"soy\" in a derogatory context.',\n",
       " 'steroids': 'The sentences that use \"steroids\" as a dog whistle, implying that trans people are drug abusers, are:\\n\\n7. \"how come females can state steroids and grow an actual dick, but if a guy takes it, it causes his junk to shrivel up? science ain\\'t fair\"\\n\\n8. \"I think my beliefs are largely in line with yours. LGB is fine, T+ gets a little kookie. I think it\\'s wrong to try to solve a mental issue with a physical/cosmetic surgery. If someone claimed that deep down they always thought they were a gorilla, would the proper solution be to pump them full of steroids and hormones that make them gain muscle mass and grow hair all over their body?\"\\n\\nThese sentences conflate steroid use with gender-affirming treatments, perpetuating a transphobic narrative.',\n",
       " 'terrorist': 'The sentences that use \"terrorist\" as a dog whistle targeting Muslim people are:\\n\\n5. \"We pulled out of Afghanistan and effectively gave it to the Taliban, aka the \\'terrorists\\' we were fighting. The terrorists won.\"\\n\\n6. \"Somewhere like Poland is very capable of reaquiring its artifacts and looking after them, whereas somewhere like Somali just flat out isn\\'t. And even then there\\'s regions where things can change, I remember the incident of a Syrian museum custodian being murdered by Islamic terrorists for refusing to give over ancient Mesopotamian artifacts so the Muslims could destroy them. I\\'ve seen ancient Mesopotamian reliefs in the British Museum, if left in situ, they\\'d have end up like Ninevah, demolished.\"\\n\\n9. \"They got caught doing that with Muslims post 9/11. 9 out of 10 times you read about them catching a terrorist before they strike it\\'s a teen they radicalized and then arrest after very toe to line encouraging but technically not entrapping.\"\\n\\nThese sentences imply that Muslims as a whole are a threat, fitting the definition of a dog whistle.',\n",
       " 'welfare': 'The sentences that use \"welfare\" as a dog whistle, implying racial minorities receive undeserved government aid, are:\\n\\n1. \"Democrats are already trying to send monthly welfare payments to people who are here illegally.\"\\n2. \"There would be a continuation of inflationary welfare payments that Washington is sending out with zero work requirements whatsoever, and illegal immigrants would get the money as well.\"\\n\\nThese sentences link welfare to illegal immigration, suggesting recipients are undeserving, which can be interpreted as a dog whistle with racial connotations.'}"
